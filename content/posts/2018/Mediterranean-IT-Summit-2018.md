Yesterday's second half started with a flight to Antalya, Turkey. In case you missed the first half, look at my previous post :) This time I was not alone on my trip to Antalya. [Yiğit Özaksut](https://twitter.com/ozaksuty), a fellow MVP was with me.  I think it was fair for a conference of this size.  Two thousand five hundred attendees! Pretty amazing right? The event team did a fantastic job! It is their 4th year in a row getting the [Mediterranean IT Summit](http://www.akdenizbilisimzirvesi.com/) organized. I had the chance to be one of their speakers at their first run four years ago. It's impressive how they consistently grew the event every.

It is always nice to be in Antalya for an event, maybe that's the good weather down there (relative south), but one definitely feels the mood-boost :) As always, I have so many people to thank. First off, the team, everyone involved in the event organization, [Piksel Akademi](https://pikselakademi.com.tr/) for leading the flag, **Microsoft Turkey** for getting us our flight tickets :) and finally everyone who joined us! Thanks for being there with us! You rock!
