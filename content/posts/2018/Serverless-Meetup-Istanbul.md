Yesterday was the day of Serverless Meetup for Istanbul. Last month I had the chance to speak about Azure Functions at the [Serverless Meetup in Ankara](https://daron.blog/serverless-meetup-ankara). As a follow-up, we had already planned to do the same in Istanbul as well. It happened yesterday :) Thanks for the [Serverless Turkey Meetup](https://twitter.com/serverlesstr) team taking care of logistics for these events. I have been doing it in the past, and I know how hard it is to keep a meetup group up and running. Kudos to the team!

As always the highlight of the day was, again, **Durable Functions**. No surprises there. I'm eagerly looking forward to the GA of Durable Functions. I'm planning to write a comparison of AWS Step Functions vs Azure Logic Apps and Durable Functions at some point. Stay tuned. 

In case you did not grab the slides yet, [here they are](http://daron.me/decks) ;) 

See you on the next one.
