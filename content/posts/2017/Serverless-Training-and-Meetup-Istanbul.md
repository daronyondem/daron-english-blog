Serverless is catching up! I just hosted a one-day serverless training for Microsoft Turkey this week, which might be the first one ever in the country.  We had a wide variety of topics starting from eventing to function orchestration. Of course, **Azure Functions** is the king of the town, but when it comes to creating a full-blown serverless app, you need to make sure you got services like **Azure API Management**, **Azure Event Grid** and **CosmosDB** in the picture.

Just the next day of the training, I got invited to speak about Serverless at the local **[Microsoft Entrepreneurship Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/tr-TR/Microsoft-Giri%C5%9Fimcilik-Bulu%C5%9Fmalar%C4%B1/events/245660722/?eventId=245660722)** group for their December meetup. Having a full day content ready to go made it easy to mix and match my presentations based on attendee interest, and questions. As usual, I got all my [slides uploaded here](http://daron.me/decks ).
