Yesterday I was in Beirut, Lebanon. I had the opportunity to speak at the Lebanon **Cloud Empowerment Summit**. My sessions were about DevOps, including topics like **CI/CD with VSTS, Containers, Azure Container Instances and Azure Container Registry**. If you feel like there is a pattern here, indeed there is. Following the recent Dubai event, this is the second stop of my DevOps tour in MEA. I'm definitely not going to expose the full tour schedule and will keep it as a surprise :)

As always you can find all the slides I used at [http://daron.me/decks](http://daron.me/decks). I have plans sharing some of my demos and content here in the form of blog posts, but right now I'm pretty much buried in a long list of offline events. Wish me luck, and stay tuned!
