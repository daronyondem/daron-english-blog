I love to talk about soft skills :) If you can read Turkish, you might be interested in my book titled ["One Shot Before Sleep."](http://uykudanoncebirdoz.com/) I'm still in the progress of writing it, but it is open to purchase in its current state, thanks to Leanpub. 

I get invited to various career-oriented university events to talk about my career that I had the chance to craft so far. Don't get me wrong. I don't think there is anything extraordinary in my life that makes me deserve a speaker spot in a career event (Imposter syndrome? or not, you decide).  With that said, I have some thoughts I can share :) Why shouldn't I hold myself back if people are interested in listening?

This time I get invited to the career day of one of the most significant IT Communities in Turkey, called CozumPark. During my session, I played around the idea of "how to mother yourself," and why should you. It is a pretty fun topic. [Here is a short read](https://psychcentral.com/lib/10-tips-for-the-best-mothering-self-love/) if interested.

Thanks to everyone who joined me in my talk, and the organizers for having me! See you at the next one.
