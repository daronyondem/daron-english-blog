Yesterday I was the guest of a [CozumPark event](http://etkinlik.cozumpark.com/etkinlik/iot-on-azure/854) focused around IoT on Azure. For those of you, living outside of Turkey, CozumPark is one of the biggest IT Communities in Turkey :) I did a pretty short, 20 minutes talk introducing IoT Hub from scratch answering some fundamental questions like "why does it exist?" and "how IoT Hub helps to accelerate scalable IoT implementations in the cloud?".

Huge thanks to everyone who showed up for the sessions! Big thanks to CozumPark for having me as a speaker in their event, and gathering such a great speaker group. Already looking forward to the next one :)  

That's it for now! See you on the next one ;)
