Eight parallel tracks and 64+ sessions in a single day is what CozumPark Tech Talks was about. I'm so lucky to be part of this event leading the AI Track and having awesome speakers join me, making the day an excellent experience! So proud!

Huge thanks to our AI track speakers, [Cihan Yakar](https://twitter.com/cihanyakar), Fırat Gönen, and [Merve Cerit](https://twitter.com/mmervecerit). Cihan drove five hours round trip to join us from Ankara. Merve had to stay awake for an 11 PM conference call in her evening in San Francisco :) Fırat was in town, and as usual, locals never get enough appreciation :)

Finally, big thanks to Cozumpark leadership for handing me the ownership of the AI track, and thanks to everyone who joined us during the day
