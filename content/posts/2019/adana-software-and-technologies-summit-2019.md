Recently, most of my weekends are booked with speaking engagements.  I'm joining various Google Developer Groups taking the stage in their DevFest events. I will be blogging about them soon in a batch :) otherwise, it might just look like a flood in my blog. Considering all that, this one is just out of the ordinary. [Cukurova University IEEE Student Branch](https://www.cuieee.org/) organizes its Software and Technology Summit every year. I had the chance to join them again for 2019. We talked about AI and looked deeper into the concept of Serverless AI.

Huge thanks to the IEEE team for keeping up the flag ;) Below are my slides from my session if interested.

Ciao!
