That's a hefty title :) following a pretty big event. Yesterday we had our local Visual Studio 2019 Community Launch. These are events sponsored by Microsoft and delivered by volunteers. In this case, I took the flag, and many more community heroes joined on stage making it a beautiful evening. Topics covered ML, Xamarin, Azure, the IDE itself üëç

Thanks, everyone for being with us, and huge thanks to our local Microsoft Turkey folks helping out with the logistics. We don't have presentations or recordings to share. The local launch was simply a reflection of the global event, and [here you can find all the recordings of the global event](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Visual-Studio/Visual-Studio-2019-Launch-Event) anyways :) Enjoy.
