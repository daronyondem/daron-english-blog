As we close out another year, it's time to share my journey - a blend of vulnerability and optimism. Here's a look back at the year that was and a peek into what's next.

## Health, the bumpy road

This year was a test of resilience, especially in terms of health and fitness. Remember when I said, "Sometimes an accidental injury or sickness can derail everything"? That was in my 2022 report. That summed up my 2023. A routine 5K run led to an IT-Band injury, disrupting my exercise routine and leading to some weight gain. I’m currently at 126 Kgs (277 lbs), a noticeable increase from the start of the year. Despite this setback, I've learned a lot about the importance of having a fallback plan for exercise and maintaining pillar habits.

So what did I learn? What happened? The injury was expected, but I was not prepared with a fall back plan for my exercise routine and I was not aware how most of my habits were stacked on a morning run. Next time when the dark clouds come in I need to ensure I have a backup plan for my pillar habits. 

Looking forward, my goal for 2024 is to dip under 100 Kgs (220 lbs) and hopefully, lace up for a marathon. It's about getting back on track, and a marathon would be the cherry on top!

## Business

Our cloud application innovation team at Microsoft has been making waves, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it. Transitioning from a small startup to a giant like Microsoft has been an adventure in itself. Some of the Serverless transformations we did with customers were the highlight of my year for me. 

Additionally, I have started doing one on one coaching sessions as a side business. I have been doing this for a while but I have formalized it in 2023. I'm using Superpeer as the platform for this. If you are interested in getting some coaching from me, you can [book a session here](https://superpeer.com/daronyondem). 

## Giving Back

Giving back remains a cornerstone of my year. I delivered 15 community sessions as a volunteer speaker and published 50 videos on my Turkish YouTube channel, focusing on technical and soft skills. These include 2 hour long extensive AI trainings. For 2024, I’m excited to contribute more. Our Superpeer community, with a new Discord server, is growing, and I invite you to be a part of it. The community is primarly Turkish speaking but you are more then welcome to join and ask questions in English as well.

## Growth

2023 was monumental for my growth. I'm halfway through my Ph.D. in Leadership Studies and have embarked on the [Health and Wellness Coaching](https://rm.edu/hwc/) program at Rocky Mountain University for Health Professions. This journey, though demanding (hello, 2 AM classes!), has been enlightening. I am now a certified Health and Wellness Coach and am aiming for the National Board Certification in 2024. The program has been immensely eye-opening, particularly in motivational interviewing techniques and in helping people change their behavior. These skills are critical in any setting and are deeply connected to practical leadership and influence building. Another win for 2023 was starting personal therapy sessions, pushing myself outside my comfort zone. I have to admit, I could not have foreseen this, but the coaching training and therapy sessions, in conjunction, have given me a completely different perspective on coaching and behavior change. Not to promote my own side business, but I must admit that the impact of both coaching and therapy is significant. I've seen this with some of my clients as well. Sometimes, I am amazed at how much I can help them in just a single session.

## Future Look

Every new beginning comes with a sense of hope, and I'm eager to see what the next year holds. The journey continues with my Ph.D., coaching sessions, community involvement, YouTube content creation, and my role at Microsoft. I'm keen to return to running and embrace healthier habits. The goal is to continue growing, learning, and enjoying every step of the way.

Here's to a year of challenges, growth, and looking forward to the adventures that lie ahead!
