Wow. Another year went by, and we are still in the COVID world. Does not that pretty much summarizes the situation? ðŸ˜Š So what happened in my world for 2021? 

Remember the last year's report? Of course not, but long story short, I had [all my weight loss](/2019/one-year-of-healthy-living/) rolled back, weighting around 150Kgs / 330lbs. Beginning of April 2021, I decided to get things back on track. I have started dieting, cutting junk food that we all know makes us fat. That started the weight loss pretty nicely. Once I was down to 125Kgs / 275lbs, around October 2021, I started adding some cardio. So far, I'm still following the same pattern. I'm doing 40 minutes of indoor cycling every other day targeting [75% of max HR bpm range](https://www.polar.com/blog/running-heart-rate-zones-basics/). Today I weight 112Kgs / 246lbs with a total loss of 38Kgs / 84lbs in 9 months. Not bad ðŸ˜Š. My plan is to keep doing what I do and eventually switch to outdoor running around 100-90kgs / 220-200lbs. There goes a win for 2021.

On the business side of 2021, I joined Microsoft. It happened. Throughout the years as an [MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/4015692?fullName=Daron%20Yondem) and [RD](https://rd.microsoft.com/en-us/) I have always fought against the perception that I was a Microsoft employee where I simply was an independent influencer and subject matter expert. Now, I don't have to do that anymore ðŸ˜Š I have joined Microsoft to lead the Azure Application Development efforts in the Middle East and Africa across Corporate, Medium, and Small Business segments. We are building a new team, and I love the challenge so far. With that said, after about 10+ years in global startups, it is a significant shift that is still pushing me to think outside my box. 

When it comes to studies ðŸ˜Š unfortunately, I did not finish my Master's in Organizational Leadership yet. This past summer, I went through a gallbladder removal operation, which slowed down things. Thankfully I'm on my last course and will finish the program end of January 2022. So, this win goes for 2022 next year ðŸ˜Š. Overall, going through a second Master's was definitely worth my time. I loved every course and topic I studied. It gave me a throughout understanding of the function of people in organizations; organizational behavior has been my favorite topic.

In contrast to all the progress, my community contributions and blogging did suffer a bit. I did not blog much, and my community contributions were only 18 sessions delivered online in various conferences, local and global. From a speaking engagement perspective, I did pretty well, but the rest did not hold up. Same with the number of books I could read, only seven books ðŸ˜¢. I wish I did count the number of research papers I had to read ðŸ˜‚. Jokes aside, I'm not very worried about the number of books read for now, as I was pretty buried into my Master's. I will see If I want to change directions in 2022.  

As you can tell, I don't really have rigid plans at the beginning of the year. I don't make resolutions either. However, there are a couple of things where I would enjoy seeing more progress. First, I want to keep up the amount and the diversity of the content I digest to learn and grow. So far, my master's degree has helped with this, but I have to keep it up with some other ways in 2022. Second, I want to keep the momentum on my healthy living habits and hopefully finish a half marathon. Third... I don't know ðŸ˜Š We will see. Aren't those all the unknowns that make a new year exciting anyways?

I wish you all a happy 2022! See you soon!
