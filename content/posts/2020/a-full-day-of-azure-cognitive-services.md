Yesterday was another busy Saturday :) A full day of Azure Cognitive Services Training is what happened. Look at the agenda below, isn't that beautiful?

9.15-10.00 Azure Cognitive Speech Services  
10.15-11.00 Azure Cognitive Vision Services  
11.15-12.00 Azure Cognitive Language Services  
12.00-13.00 Launch  
13:00–13:20 Building an AI Ready Network - Arista Networks  
13:20–13:40 Azure Cognitive Decision Services  
14.00-14.45 Azure Cognitive Search   
15.00-15.45 Azure Bot Services  
16.00-16.45 Lab  

This is a full day, free AI training we were able to host thanks to the sponsorships of the local Microsoft office , [Deep Learning Turkey](http://deeplearningturkiye.org/) and Arista Networks. Another huge applause to our team at [Cozumpark](https://www.cozumpark.com/) for organizing the event! I was just the trainer who came in, talked a lot and left :)

I'm hoping we scale this training across the country. That all depends on COVID-19 at this point :( I will see if I can do something online as well. I know that a lot of you asked for an online option on twitter :) I hear you! Stay tuned with my updates on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/daronyondem), or [subscribe to the mailings list](https://us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=221fa688556db43335ce36eef&id=9fcfba435a) ;)

See you on the next one ;)
