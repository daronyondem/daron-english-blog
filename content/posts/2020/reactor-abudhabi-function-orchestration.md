Azure Durable Functions is always a fun topic to talk about, and there is not a better way to find a reason for it other than introducing it with Logic Apps for function orchestration in Azure. Just love it! This time around, I presented the topic to an audience in Abu Dhabi. Huge thanks to the Microsoft Reactor User Group located in the city.
