A virtual event that goes for 30 hours, non-stop! That's it, that is more than enough to respect what the organizers accomplished here :) Running a global event, non-stop for 30 hours with speakers from all around the world, is a huge accomplishment. Here is the [full list of all the sessions and their recordings](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMjtoLHNjR0uRFRoaBHPgiAo6gWBNaaZh) for your enjoyment :)

My session was about Serverless AI and getting AI implementations into your applications with the least amount of investment as possible. Feel free to watch the on-demand version below. Here are the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/daronyondem/implementing-ai-into-your-apps-without-learning-ai) and [demo code](https://github.com/daronyondem/AzureOrnekler/tree/master/Cognitive-Services) that I used during my presentation.
