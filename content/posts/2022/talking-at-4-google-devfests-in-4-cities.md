As a fan of Google Developer Group (GDG) events, I was thrilled to have the opportunity to speak at four events in four different cities this past month. Rather than discussing a purely technical topic, I chose to explore the human aspect of developer velocity and its relationship to the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence. My session covered the influence of organizational culture, team management, and technology on software engineering teams. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and I appreciate all the comments and insights I've received so far. Keep them coming!

I would like to express my gratitude to all those who have played a role in organizing and supporting GDG events nationwide. Your efforts are truly admirable and are greatly benefiting the community with a level of inclusivity and diversity that is rare in the tech ecosystem. Please, keep up the excellent work! I am always here to support you in any way that I can.

And now, here are some photos from each event as souvenirs:
