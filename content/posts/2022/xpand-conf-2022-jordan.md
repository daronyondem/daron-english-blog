This last weekend I had the privilege to join the [xpand conference](https://www.xpandconf.com/) in Jordan as a speaker talking about function orchestration in the serverless world. For those following my work in the community, I'm sure the topic is not a surprise 😃. However, the location might be.

This was not my first visit to Jordan. I love the country and the people. I had the chance to speak at various events over the years. The level of interest in technology and software is always extraordinary in Amman. However, xpand was a whole different game! Not a surprise to me, the team delivered a top-notch conference with all the aspects of a global technology event one can think of. Worth mentioning, as always, is the fantastic Jordan hospitality ❤️.

If you did not attend xpand this year, ensure you bookmark the conference page today and keep an eye out for next year's event. That's what I will do for sure. The line of speakers was terrific. The community is simply outstanding. The discussions we had between the sessions with attendees were fun and educational. You have to be there if you are in Jordan. If not, it's definitely worth considering it as part of your next year's travel plans. You might even want to include a road trip to Petra 
😉.

Huge congratulations to the team for doing such a fantastic job, and special thanks to all the sponsors supporting the event 🙏. Hopefully 😊 see you next year!
