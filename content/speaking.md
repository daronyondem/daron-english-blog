It all started when they asked me If I would like to speak about what I wrote. Since then, I love speaking, and I was lucky enough to be invited to more than 20 countries to speak at numerous conferences, meetups, events. I spoke about personal branding, social media strategy, productivity, career planning, and .NET, user experience, cloud computing, and more.

Here is where I'm planning to be next;
