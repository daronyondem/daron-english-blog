Hi, I am Daron.

Starting from the kid who wrote QBasic, it's been a long journey. My years spanned out across client app dev, back-end, cloud, and who knows where it will go. I led engineering teams at multiple startups and organizations of various sizes along the way. I'm currently leading Azure Application Development for Small, Medium, and Corporate businesses in the Middle East and Africa for Microsoft.

The desire to share what I discovered resulted in me being a public speaker at various events and conferences. I figured I love it! In a previous life, Microsoft called me a [MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/4015692) and [RD](http://rd.microsoft.com/daron.yondem) for 14 years. My recent love is Serverless AI! 

If you want to have me in an event of yours, feel free to [look at the past events](/speaking) I spoke to get a feel of what I can talk about :)

If you want to reach out my e-mail is "myfirstname@mylastname.com" üëç  

See you around!
