Hi, I am Daron.

Starting from the kid who wrote QBasic, it's been a long journey. My years spanned out across client app dev, back-end, cloud, and who knows where it will go. I led engineering teams at multiple startups and organizations in various sizes during the way.

The desire to share what I discover resulted in me being a public speaker in various events and conferences. I figured I love it! Microsoft calls me a [MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/4015692) and [RD](http://rd.microsoft.com/daron.yondem) for 12 years now. My recent love is Serverless! 

If you want to have me in an event of yours, feel free to [look at the past events](/speaking) I spoke to get a feel of what I can talk about :)

If you want to reach out my e-mail is "myfirstname@mylastname.com" üëç  

See you around!
