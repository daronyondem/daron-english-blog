Yesterday I was in **Dubai** hosting the **Microsoft DevOps Day**, part of the Microsoft Master Development Series. The full day consisted of [six sessions](https://twitter.com/daronyondem/status/923416131393802240) ranging from IaC to Containers.

I should say that the stars of the day were ARM Templates and Containers. Always love to demo those in a CI/CD Pipeline. For those of you who are not able to attend an event, but still interested in the content I have plans on releasing separated videos about all these topics. Stay tuned. Or, I might just record an actual event the next time I present the same content. 

Huge thanks to everyone involved in organizing the day and everyone who was there with us the whole day. Thank you!

Keep in touch, and hopefully see you next time.
