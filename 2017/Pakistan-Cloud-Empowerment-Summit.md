Yesterday I was in Karachi, Pakistan, talking at the **Cloud Empowerment Summit** about DevOps, **CI/CD with VSTS, Containers, Azure Container Instances and Azure Container Registry**. This is the third stop of my DevOps tour in MEA. It was my first time in Pakistan, and to be honest, I didn't have the chance to discover the city that much. I was in the country for just a day. However, I loved the tech audience there. This has been so far one of the best events in the context of the questions I received during my sessions and more during the breaks.
