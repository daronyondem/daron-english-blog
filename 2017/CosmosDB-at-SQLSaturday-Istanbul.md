Yesterday was the day of **SQL Saturday** for Istanbul. Thanks to an invitation from my RD peer [Koray Kocaba≈ü](https://twitter.com/koraykocabas?lang=en) I had the chance to talk about CosmosDB. I should thank [Rimma Nehme](https://twitter.com/rimmanehme) as well, for her support getting my presentation content straight :)

CosmosDB is one of the services in Azure which I'm in love with. While at it, let me give you the full list, Azure Functions, Container Instances and CosmosDB :) As you might have noticed I'm all for high level, managed services. CosmosDB is a serious game changer and will continue changing our expectations of a cloud database engine. I have heard some rumors that the upcoming [Microsoft Connect](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/connectevent/default.aspx) event will have some fantastic news about CosmosDB. Go ahead, save the date, it is November 15-17. 

Unfortunately, this time I don't have a recording of my session. I do have the slides to share tough.

As always, for anything, ping me on Twitter!

See you next time.
