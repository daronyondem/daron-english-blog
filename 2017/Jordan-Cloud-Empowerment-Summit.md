Yesterday I was in Amman, Jordan, talking (again :)) at the **Cloud Empowerment Summit** about DevOps, **CI/CD with VSTS, Containers, Azure Container Instances and Azure Container Registry**. This is the fourth stop of my DevOps tour in MEA. Amman always has a special place for me; Petra and Dead See are lovely places. Of course for this round, I didn't have the chance to visit anywhere, except [Fuddruckers](http://4sq.com/cU2hSW), which is one of my favorite hamburger places in Amman. Can't skip mentioning [Shake and Bake](http://4sq.com/15GpfwO) which is another favorite of mine. Oh btw, huge thanks to [Ammar Hasayen](https://twitter.com/ammarhasayen) for his hospitality and taking me to the dinner :) I owe you mate!

The decks I use during the DevOps Roadshow are the same in all locations. Here is the link for those who missed it in my previous blog posts [http://daron.me/decks](http://daron.me/decks). See you in another one ;)
