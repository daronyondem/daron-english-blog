Today, I was at the **Spark Day Istanbul** hosting a session about **CosmosDB** and mainly how it can be used in conjunction with Spark. The **[Azure CosmosDB Spark Connector](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cosmosdb-spark)** with the [Python SDK for DocumentDB](https://github.com/Azure/azure-documentdb-python), or the [Java SDK for DocumentDB](https://github.com/Azure/azure-documentdb-java)  eases the integration between Spark and CosmosDB. For those of you interested for more than what I demoed during my session [here is a link to a set Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cosmosdb-spark/tree/master/samples/notebooks)  you can grab and play with.

The slide deck below might look familiar :) This is simply the same slide deck I use for my CosmosDB sessions with a slight **Spark** flavor at the end.
